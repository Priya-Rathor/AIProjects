# 🧠 Generative AI & NLP Projects by Priya Rathor

Welcome to my repository focused on **Generative AI**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Deep Learning** using tools like **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, and **Weaviate**. This is a hands-on, project-based journey where I explore the latest in transformer models, text/image generation, semantic search, and more.

> 🚀 Built using Python, Google Colab, Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API, and Weaviate vector database.

## 🔍 What You’ll Learn

- How to interact with OpenAI’s GPT APIs
- Using Hugging Face for:
  - Text classification
  - Summarization
  - Tokenization
  - Image generation
- Deploying vector databases like Weaviate for semantic search
- CNN implementation in TensorFlow/Keras
- Running models efficiently using Google Colab

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

> Preferably run the notebooks in Google Colab for hassle-free environment management.

### 🔁 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priya-Rathor/generative-ai-nlp.git
cd generative-ai-nlp
````

### 📦 Install Dependencies

You can install the required libraries locally using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install them one-by-one inside Colab based on the notebook you're using.

## 🔐 API Keys Required

Some notebooks require API access.

* **OpenAI**

  * Get your key from: [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
  * Use: `openai.api_key = "your_key"`

* **Hugging Face**

  * Create an account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/)
  * Use the key via `transformers` CLI or set in notebook

* **Weaviate**

  * Use Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) or local Docker instance
  * Configure `.env` or inline keys
